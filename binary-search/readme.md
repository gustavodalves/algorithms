# Binary Search Algorithm

Binary search is a more efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted list. It follows a divide-and-conquer strategy, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Algorithm

The binary search algorithm follows these steps:

1. Initialize the start and end indices of the search interval.
2. While the start index is less than or equal to the end index:
   - Calculate the middle index.
   - If the element at the middle index is equal to the target value, the value was found; return the index.
   - If the target value is less than the middle element, update the end index to mid - 1.
   - If the target value is greater than the middle element, update the start index to mid + 1.
3. If the start index exceeds the end index, the target value is not present in the list.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where "n" is the size of the sorted list. This makes binary search more efficient than linear search for large datasets.

## Precondition

For the binary search algorithm to work correctly, the input list must be sorted in ascending order.

*Note: Consider that binary search is most effective when working with sorted lists, and the overhead of sorting should be factored into overall performance considerations.*
